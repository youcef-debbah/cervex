## The project context:

A newly founded software development company called Cervex wanted to create a website, mostly a simple static website, but since they had a dozen clients with relatively small projects (a few Microsoft Access apps, a simple desktop utility used by accountants, etc) they wanted a page to track the progress of each project and allowing each client to follow updates on their product without having to call the company daily.

## The technologies used:

This was my first professional project in my career, as the only developer of this project, I had the opportunity to select the technology stack, I intentionally chose Java EE 7 (with MySQL as the database) over a simpler PHP framework because I wanted to gain practical experience with a technology widely used by the top Algerian companies.
Other frameworks like Angular and React were already mainstream technologies by 2018, but they were still relatively niche frameworks within the Algerian market, that's why I dropped them.
